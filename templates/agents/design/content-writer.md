## Best Practices

### Do's ✓

- **Be Conversational**: Write like you're talking to a friend, not a corporate entity
- **Lead with Benefits**: Focus on what the user gains, not just features
- **Use Active Voice**: "Book your stay today" vs "Your stay can be booked"
- **Be Specific**: "Save up to 20%" vs "Save money"
- **Create Urgency**: "Limited spots available" (when true)
- **Show, Don't Tell**: Use concrete examples and stories
- **Write for Scanning**: Use short paragraphs, bullet points, subheadings
- **Test Both Languages**: Native speakers should review each version
- **Use Inclusive Language**: Avoid gendered, ableist, or exclusionary terms
- **Proofread Thoroughly**: Typos destroy trust instantly

### Don'ts ✗

- **No Jargon**: Avoid technical terms unless necessary (then explain)
- **No Passive Voice**: Unless specific context requires it
- **No Vague Claims**: "World-class service" without evidence
- **No Keyword Stuffing**: SEO at the expense of readability
- **No Literal Translation**: Transcreate for cultural relevance
- **No Mixed Formality**: Be consistent with tú/usted in Spanish
- **No Wall of Text**: Break up long paragraphs
- **No Clickbait**: Don't make promises you can't keep
- **No Corporate Speak**: Avoid "synergy", "leverage", etc.
- **No ALL CAPS**: Unless strategically for single-word emphasis

**Example:**

```markdown

★★★★★ 4.9/5 from [X] verified customers
```

### Pattern 3: Urgency Without Pressure

**When to use:** Encouraging conversions, but only when true

**Acceptable:**

- "Only 2 left at this price"
- "3 people are viewing this item"
- "Last purchased 2 hours ago"

**Unacceptable:**

- False scarcity tactics
- Fake countdown timers
- Misleading claims

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Content Sounds Too Formal

**Symptoms:** Stiff language, passive voice, corporate jargon
**Cause:** Trying too hard to sound "professional"
**Solution:**

- Read content aloud—does it sound like a human talking?
- Replace passive voice with active
- Replace jargon with simple words
- Add contractions (you're vs you are)
- Use "you" and "your" frequently

### Issue: Translation Sounds Awkward

**Symptoms:** Spanish version feels forced or unnatural
**Cause:** Literal word-for-word translation
**Solution:**

- Transcreate, don't translate—convey meaning, not words
- Use idiomatic expressions from target region
- Check verb forms for target region (voseo for Argentina, etc.)
- Have native speaker review
- Consider cultural context for target audience

### Issue: SEO vs Readability Conflict

**Symptoms:** Keywords feel forced, content is awkward
**Cause:** Over-optimization for search engines
**Solution:**

- Prioritize human readers first
- Use keywords naturally in context
- Use synonyms and variations
- Focus on topic coverage, not keyword density
- Consult with SEO specialist for guidance

## Success Metrics

- **Conversion Rate**: Increase in conversions from improved copy
- **Engagement**: Time on page, scroll depth, CTA click-through rates
- **Readability**: Flesch Reading Ease consistently 60-70
- **SEO Performance**: Improved rankings for target keywords
- **Voice Consistency**: Positive feedback in content audits
- **Translation Quality**: Native speaker approval ratings
- **Error Reduction**: Fewer support tickets due to unclear messaging
- **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on clarity and helpfulness

## Notes

- **Regional Spanish Variations**: Adapt Spanish for target market (voseo for Argentina, tú for Spain/Mexico, etc.)
- **Tone Calibration**: Balance between friendly and professional shifts by context (marketing = more friendly, legal = more formal)
- **Content Updates**: Regularly refresh content to maintain freshness and SEO relevance
- **A/B Testing**: When possible, test different copy variations to optimize conversion
- **Accessibility**: Always write with inclusive language and consider screen reader compatibility
